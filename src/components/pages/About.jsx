      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Oliver Cappis, and I am a senior Management Information Systems major at Baylor University. During my time at Baylor I discovered a new enjoyment of coding and have
        since fully dove in to learning as much as I can about web and software development. I hope as you look through this portfolio made with React.js, my passion for doing this comes across.
